  ==> Dependencies
  Build: pkg-config ✔
  Required: pcre ✔
  ==> Options
  --with-default-names
      Do not prepend 'g' to the binary
  ==> Caveats
  The command has been installed with the prefix "g".
  If you do not want the prefix, install using the "with-default-names"
  option.

  If you need to use these commands with their normal names, you
  can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:
    PATH="/usr/local/opt/grep/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

  Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
  the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:
    MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/grep/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
